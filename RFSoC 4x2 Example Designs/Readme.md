##### This folder contains mutliple example designs bifiles and their respective Vivado project files.
##### There are plenty of examples in RFSoC SDR book attached in 'Introduction to Board' folder, which are at application layer i.e., at Jupyter IDE level.
##### These examples are designed by us to work at vivado hardware design level and experiment with GPIO, FPGA Coding, Board UART and SD Programming, Clock Configuring, IP Generation and Data Converter Streaming using AXI.
##### These are blocks of puzzle we essentially in designing a big desgin for any SDR application on RFSoC board.
##### So, these examples help in understanding basic skills related to SDR design on Zynq Boards.
